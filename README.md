## Overview

Poti is a simple backup tool that downloads a directory from a "server" to your local storage.

It's best used within a local network for backing up or copying containers or folders.
Setup / Installation

Please refer to the README files in both the poti and poti-client folders for installation instructions.

- poti acts as the server (i.e., the machine you want to back up files from).
- poti-client is the UI client that connects to the server.

## Developing

I created start_vs.sh to quickly launch VS Code with both poti and poti-client projects open.

The poti-client is built using Tauri.
